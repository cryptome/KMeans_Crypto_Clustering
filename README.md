# KMeans_Crypto_Clustering
Using KMeans algorithm to group tradable cryptocurrencies

This Jupyter notebook is a report of what cryptocurrencies are available on the trading market, and how they can be grouped using classification.

All data is retrieved from *Crypto Compare*, then preprocessed/cleaned before using the PCA algorithm to reduce data dimensions. Then using the KMeans algorithm clusters of cryptocurrencies are generated and plotted, leaving us with 131 tradable cryptocurrencies.
